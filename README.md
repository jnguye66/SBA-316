DESCRIPTION:

This is a website that allows for a user to create their own character in Honkai Star Rail (limited use).
Currently there are only three characters and three light cones for the user to choose from. The user is able to choose their equipment,
as well as their relic main stats. The program prompts out to the user what their stats are, which is generated randomly between certain
restraints, just to make sure they don't automatically lose.
